${isMod ? `
**Setup**
Use ${CommandService.GetCommandString(guild, CommandConstants.COMMANDS.CHANNEL[0], ['add'])} in the channels where members should be allowed to play Sudoku.
Use ${CommandService.GetCommandString(guild, CommandConstants.COMMANDS.PREFIX[0], ['prefix'])} to set the prefix for the commands.
` : ''}
**Playing Sudoku**
Use ${CommandService.GetCommandString(guild, CommandConstants.COMMANDS.PLAY[0])} to get a Sudoku to solve.
Use ${CommandService.GetCommandString(guild, CommandConstants.COMMANDS.PLAY[0], ['vs @person'])} to challenge someone.
Use ${CommandService.GetCommandString(guild, CommandConstants.COMMANDS.PLAY[0], ['royale'])} to challenge everyone.

You will need a streak of at least 5 solves to set a time for your Fastest Average of Five. Only Singleplayer Sudoku will extend your streak.
Starting a Singleplayer Sudoku but not finishing it in ${SettingsConstants.PLAY_EXPIRE_TIME_TEXT} will reset your streak.

**Statistics**
Use ${CommandService.GetCommandString(guild, CommandConstants.COMMANDS.STATS[0])} to get your statistics.

**Name**
Use ${CommandService.GetCommandString(guild, CommandConstants.COMMANDS.NAME[0])} to set a custom name to use on the leaderboards instead of your Discord username.

For information about the rules use ${CommandService.GetCommandString(guild, CommandConstants.COMMANDS.RULES[0])}.
For information about the developer use ${CommandService.GetCommandString(guild, CommandConstants.COMMANDS.DEVELOPER[0])}.
For information about donating use ${CommandService.GetCommandString(guild, CommandConstants.COMMANDS.DONATE[0])} ${EmojiConstants.HEART}.

If you have a question or want to report a problem, you can contact the developer in the [support server](${SettingsConstants.SUPPORT_SERVER_INVITE_URL}).
You can use [this](${SettingsConstants.BOT_INVITE_URL}) link to add the bot to your own server.

**#1.** It is allowed to use any tool to solve the Sudokus, as long as that tool does not tell you what number goes where. The tool is allowed to highlight all the occurences of a number, and give you the possibility to add pencil markers.

**#2.** It is not allowed to use this bot with an offensive username, as this name might appear on the leaderboard for others to read. Follow the Discord guidelines and you should be fine.
